            <h2>About Aspire</h2>
            <p>
              Aspire is a content managment system created on the django platform by Mark Hart.  
              It is designed to be the base of any content managment website and can be built out 
              with additional featues based on business needs. This is the 4th iteration of this 
              web application. This is a clean and tweaked version of a working django web application
              and is intended to be cloned for any other projects. ♥
            </p>
            <p>
              While there are some dynamic aspects of the website, the current vision is not a one size fit all but 
              rather a lets start here and customize this for the situation. 
            </p>
