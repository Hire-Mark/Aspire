 <h2>About Aspire</h2>
<p>
    Aspire is a content managment system created on the django platform by Mark Hart.  
    It is designed to be the base of any content managment website and can be built out 
    with additional featues based on business needs. This is the 4th iteration of this 
    web application. This is a clean and tweaked version of a working django web application
    and is intended to be cloned for any other projects. ♥
